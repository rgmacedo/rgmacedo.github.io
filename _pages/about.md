I am a researcher at HASLab INESC TEC and a 3rd year PhD student at University of Minho, advised by [Prof. João Paulo](https://jtpaulo.github.io/) and [Prof. José Pereira](https://haslab.uminho.pt/jop). 
My research interests include local and distributed storage systems, with particular focus in Software-Defined Storage, programmable and distributed storage, and kernel-/user-space storage technologies.    
Currently, I am working on a Software-Defined Storage data plane framework for enforcing end-to-end performance policies in complex storage infrastructures.
