* **Feb 2022** Our paper *"Accelerating Deep Learning Training Through Transparent Storage Tiering"* was accepted at [ACM/IEEE CCGrid 2022](https://fcrlab.unime.it/ccgrid22/).     
* **Jan 2022** Our paper *"PAIO: General, Portable I/O Optimizations With Minor Application Modifications"* was accepted at [USENIX FAST 2022](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast22/).

## 2021

* **Dec 2021** The [PAStor project](https://pastor-project.github.io/) has come to an end. It was a great exploratory project, with strong set of publications.
* **Aug 2021** We have two new papers on Software-Defined Storage for Deep Learning, that were accepted at the [REX-IO Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/rexio/home), co-located with [IEEE Cluster Conference](https://clustercomp.org/2021/).    
* **Jun 2021** We have a new paper on ArXiv: [*"PAIO: A Software-Defined Storage Data Plane Framework"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03617).
* **May 2021** Our paper *"BDUS: Implementing Block Devices in User Space"* was accepted at [ACM SYSTOR 2021](https://www.systor.org/2021/).


## 2020

* **Oct 2020** The [PAStor project](https://pastor-project.github.io/) just kicked off.
* **Oct 2020** I did my research internship at [AIST](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html) during this summer (August - September).
* **Apr 2020** The [BigHPC project](https://bighpc.wavecom.pt/) just kicked off.
* **Feb 2020** Our survey on [Software-Defined Storage](https://rgmacedo.github.io/files/csur20-sds-survey/rgmacedo-csur20.pdf) systems was accepted at [ACM Computing Surveys](https://dl.acm.org/journal/csur) journal.


## 2019

* **Oct 2019** Honored to be awarded with a PhD scholarship from [Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT)](https://www.fct.pt/index.phtml.en).
* **Oct 2019** Presented our work on Dynamically Programmable Background Tasks at [DRSS'19](http://drss.inesctec.pt/) (co-located with [SRDS 2019](https://srds2019.projet.liris.cnrs.fr/)).
